- The Baetles continued their efforts in attempting to free Despoina Trebain from the stasis bubble she was discovered in.
- Returning to the warehouse, Stonop and Vegas tried a variety of ways to safely force one of the Dunamis crystals, which seemed to be repelled from the bubble as if by magnetism, into the surface of the bubble.
	- Vegas finally physically forced the crystal into the bubble because she has a 20 in strength, turning the crystal into a fine dust and sending a spiderweb of cracks across the surface of the bubble.
	- Using every Dunamis crystal in the warehouse, the bubble became so cracked it was nearly opaque but wasn't quite destroyed.
	- Attempts to physically crack the bubble further failed just as before it was cracked.
- Out of crystals, the Baetles searched for other sources
	- Kyriakos explained that the crystals had originally come from Molaesmyr, but that would have been a 5-6 day trek back into the Savalirwood.
	- The Baetles decided to look into Despoina's journals for clues, and discovered two people - 
		- Ophelia, Despoina's girlfriend
		- Sarylis, Despoina's friend from The Many Hosts in Xhorhas
	- Sarylis was ruled out due to being too far away, and none of the party having the ability to communicate magically
	- Kyriakos explained that Ophelia serves as a cleric in the temple in Shadycreek, so the Baetles headed out to the nearby Pious Den.
		- The Pious Den is a general use temple and hospital, housing several shrines for different gods, along with a section of cots to house the sick and wounded that are being treated.
- The Baetles found Ophelia fairly quickly - a tall human treating a seriously wounded man at the far end of the temple.
	- One of the silent hooded figures that seems to manage the temple was sent to fetch Ophelia at her earliest convenience.
	- After a moment, she approached, somewhat guarded, willing to speak only because she recognized Kyriakos
	- After a brief explanation of the situation and the crystals, she produced a ring she had been gifted from Despoina, which housed a polished but mostly uncut Dunamis crystal
- Returning to the warehouse, Ophelia cautiously approached the bubble
	- As she approached, there seemed to be a reaction from the bubble, and waves of a "wrong" energy washed over those present
	- After some discussion, Ophelia gathered some resolve and pressed her ring into the bubble.
		- Immediately, there was a violent explosion, sending people and objects flying backwards and knocking everyone to the ground except Ophelia and Despoina, who was now freed.
- Everyone took a moment to celebrate and explain the circumstances to the very confused Despoina.

- After several minutes, however, some of the Baetles noticed a very fine black thread floating loosely where the center of the bubble was. 
	- There was very brief discussion, immediately followed Ophelia noticing the thread and sending everyone 15 feet away.
		- Once they were away, she put up a cylindrical barrier of flying blades, locking herself inside with the thread.
			- Ophelia spread her arms, and, with them, long, brilliant wings sprouted from her back.
			- Her eyes began to glow with golden light, and similarly colored golden threads threw themselves from her chest, wrapping the black thread in immense heat and light and lifting Ophelia into the air.
		- Stonop and Vegas attempted to force their way through the barrier, and both succeeded, but only Stonop chose to pass all the way through.
			- Stonop reached out and touched Ophelia, who immediately collapsed to her knees and seemed to lose whatever energy was channeling through her.
			- The black thread, now thoroughly embroidered with golden light, sizzled and steamed, still extremely hot.
	- Ophelia explained that she felt energy from what she thought was the Negative Energy Plane, a twisted, inverted version of the Material Plane that Exandria inhabits.
		- She theorized that shattering the bubble caused a rift to form between the two planes.
		- She explained that Aeor did something similar with a weapon designed to kill the gods, which created the Shadowfell, a demiplane between the Material and Negative planes, and corrupted the Savalirwood.

- In the middle of Ophelia explaining her theories, the golden threads were violently torn and thrown across the room, and a large, void-black hand tore through the thread, a long claw piercing the torso of Ophelia.
	- She was torn back towards the thread, resulting in a violent explosion of golden light and darkness, leaving no trace of the black thread or Ophelia.
	- Despoina scrambled to try to discover a way to get her back, finding no success in her distress.
	- Suddenly, the roof of the warehouse was rent from the building, and a massive smoky black creature peered inside. (see [here](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/8/8a/Nightwalker-5e.png/revision/latest?cb=20180526174930))
		- The creature was recognized by the party as the same as the one that was seen walking through the Savalirwood about a week earlier.
	- Reacting quickly, Despoina grabbed a spell scroll from her desk and cast it, producing a large rune on the ground.
	- She pulled Kyriakos and herself onto the rune, and they immediately vanished.
	- The rest of the party ran to the rune, and found themselves standing on the streets of what  Dr. Neepus and Stonop immediately recognized as Rexxentrum.
		- Stonop, having experienced a (2 session overdue) vision from his patron, appeared at the same time, but holding out a Fang of Quajath coated in a thick gray fluid.
		- Refusing to elaborate, the party quickly moved off of the street to discuss next steps at the tavern.
	- In the tavern, Lilyana Cayd, the Lycan monster hunter the Baetles encountered in the Savalirwood, recognized the group and came over, initially upbeat in a clear misreading of the vibe of the party.
	- After some discussion, the following ideas were floated for getting help in fighting the Nightwalker likely rampaging through Shadycreek Run:
		- Lilyana would enlist the aid of all Claret Orders members she could - likely less than a dozen, but all fairly capable combatants and experienced monster hunters.
			- The Claret Orders are based in Berleben, a town in the swamps southeast of Rexxentrum.
		- Lilyana could ask her professor to request help from his mage friends - this was immediately struck down when revealed that the professor is Trent Ikithon.
		- Kyriakos offered to reach back out to the Golden Grin, a secret organization from whom they had purchased their ship, but he was unsure of their abilities in combat.
		- Vegas mentioned the currently-broken Aeorian Framework, an ancient weapon she acquired in Salsvault, and the party considered ways to repair it.
			- No one was quite sure how to repair it, but Vegas recalled Ferol Sal mentioning it required the Luxon Beacon in some way.
		- Requesting aid from the Dwendalian Empire was considered, but seemed unlikely given the Empire's disposition towards Shadycreek. It would defend itself, but it wouldn't be proactive, especially while still recovering from conflict with Xhorhas.
- The streets of Rexxentrum the next morning seemed somewhat subdued and anxious compared to the previous day.


- **Next session:** Consider what you want to do while in Rexxentrum. 
	- This is a city of 205,000, the third largest in all of Exandria, so there are many possibilities here. 
	- Somber news of some kind seems to have arrived in Rexxentrum, but the news itself was not discovered by the group yet.
		- In spite of the state of the city, there are still people about, and business seems largely uninterrupted.
	- The city is home to the Soltryce Academy, the largest university in Exandria, which is both a place of great knowledge and a place that is likely seeking out Dr. Neepus as a fugitive.
	- If you want to leave, consider where you will go and how you will get there.


Sorry that this was super long, this ended up being an extremely information-dense session. If you need me to explain anything just send me a dm :)
