- Vegas awoke to find her Pepperbox missing, eventually finding it, along with a note address to her, in Freedom's room at the inn.
	- Freedom was nowhere to be found.

- The Baetles competed in several events in the 52nd Annual Festival of Merit in Jigow:
	- Pie eating competition (Vegas won, narrowly beating Gwyn)
	- Corn maze (Stonop + Neepus cheated with Metaphysical Tether)
	- Arm wrestling (Vegas won)
	- Farming (Vegas + Gwyn won)
	- Herding Horizonbacks (Vegas heavily lost, everyone else won)
		- Dr. Neepus spoke to a tortoise and became friends, so the Baetles bought him for 200gp (+10gp for the saddle) and named him Gilly.
	- Riddles & Rhymes (The Baetles collaborated to win)
	- Swimming (Gwyn won a pyrrhic victory)

- At the Festival, the Baetles met various members of the Emerald Pact, a new adventuring group hoping to use the proceeds from the festival to kickstart their journey

That night, the Baetles had various dreams:
- Vegas recalled a moment from her past
- Stonop learned a new ability and got a tiny spark of backstory
- Gwyn saw a harrowing vision of her childhood friend
- Dr. Neepus failed a Wisdom saving throw

- The following morning, they attended a small ceremony and prepared for the final test in the Festival
